# Retrospecting on Advent of Code 2017

###### Monday January 15th, 2018

## Introduction

As a frame of reference, I'll be discussing my adventure through Advent of Code 2017, without explaining the event.
If you need more informations, I have two blog posts on the subject, which can be found [here](/blog/06-Using_Advent_of_Code_as_an_opportunity) and [there](/blog/14-Preparing_for_Advent_of_Code_2017).

This post will include keypoints I've learned through the project as well as random thoughts on the subject.

## Do It Everyday

I'm placing this at the top of the post as I believe it is the biggest takeaway I've gotten from AoC 2017.
It feels CRITICAL to treat Advent of Code as a daily task that cannot be delayed to a future day if you plan on completing it.

Although it may be anecdotal, I believe that the event should be treated the same way as forming any other habit.
Let up one day and it gets 1000 times harder to get back on track.

## Do some early preparation

## Some days are hard than others

## Think ahead

## Enjoy yourself
